# ParkingAutomation
The project aims to monitor parking spaces in a lot, detecting and counting available spots in real-time using video feed. It tracks positions of parking spaces and highlights free or occupied spots based on image processing techniques.The system uses OpenCV for real-time video analysis and processes frames to detect the number of vehicles in predefined parking spaces. It employs thresholding, blurring, and dilation techniques for identifying occupied and vacant spaces.
